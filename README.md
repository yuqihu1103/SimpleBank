**Author:** [Yuqi Hu](https://yuqihu1103.github.io/)

**Project Description:**

The Simple Bank is a backend web service, which provide APIs to:

1. Create and manage bank accounts, which are composed of owner’s name, balance, and currency.
   
2. Record all balance changes to each of the account. So that an account entry record will be created every time some money is added to or subtracted from the account.
   
3. Perform a money transfer between two accounts. This happens within a transaction: either both accounts’ balance are updated successfully or none of them are.
